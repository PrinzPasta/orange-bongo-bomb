This script allows you to simply configure restrictions about "who" can create M365-Groups in your M365-Tenant. 
I used [Microsoft's official script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/manage-creation-of-groups?view=o365-worldwide) as a reference and added some options to it.

Currently, you have to type in your Global Admin credentials for any change. (I will update the script soon in order to "force" you to type in your credentials just once).
